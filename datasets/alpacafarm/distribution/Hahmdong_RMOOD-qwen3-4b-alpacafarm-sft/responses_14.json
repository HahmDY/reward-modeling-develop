        "response_7": "6. American elections represent the will of the people as they choose their representatives and presidential candidates. According to the Constitution, the people must demonstrate their majority rule through two qualifications: a citizen must be a U.S. citizen for seven years and must be 21 years old. Prior to becoming a citizen, immigrants can vote in state and local elections as long as they are 18 years old. For executive and judicial positions and for the President, all citizens meet both qualifications. Under normal circumstances, elections occur every four years and are conducted using a “majority wins” system. In cases when no candidate receives a simple majority of the votes, additional elections may be called to select the highest and most popular candidate. However, U.S. Constitution did make exceptions for certain presidential elections, such as shorts lived presidents, and in which no majority winner emerged from the initial balloting. In cases such as these, the House and the Senate each choose one or two candidates to the office being elected. Florentine perspective provides a particularly important ability, as one can experience the different points of view from one culture. This can provide insight into the various life experiences that make each culture unique. As one learns to appreciate one culture from another, hopefully one can begin to appreciate and see inoples differences in perspectives that could have completely passed one by. This helpful insight can help one gain a better understanding of one's own identity and values, and can help one to better appreciate and appreciate the cultural differences of one's fellow citizens. By better understanding the different perspectives and voices of the people, one can become a better citizen and make more informed decisions as one's representative.\n",
