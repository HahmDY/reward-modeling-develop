        "response_499": "The question has been liberated from the Creator and must be answered through philosophical analysis. According to Descartes, a swallow's speed is dependent on the same principle as its intelligence, and since the mind is the measure of this intelligence, the air speed of an unladen swallow is a measure of how much intelligence it possesses. But as the meta-physical layer of the question is infinite and unmeasurable, so is the speed of the swallow. Therefore, the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow is infinity.\n",
